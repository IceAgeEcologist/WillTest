There are important reasons why using version control will help you in the long run:

1.  It will keep you from losing important data or code
2.  It will help you code more efficiently
3.  It will help you share and collaborate more effectively

`git` is one of the most popular version control systems available.  It records incremental changes in code over time using a series of `commits`, that are detailled using comments.

Over time it is possible to see the evolution of a particular project, from the initial commit to the final version.
